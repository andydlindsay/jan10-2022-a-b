# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest vs Cypress
* Jest
  * command line test runner
  * tests execute very quickly - cheap
  * unit and integration tests (mostly)
  * on-going (TDD) as you build
* Cypress
  * browser-based testing
  * visit the app and use it like a user (user stories)
  * done at the end
  * expensive (time-wise)


    smallest            pieces together           holistic
<< unit testing -------- integration ----------- end-to-end >>
    functions             components             user stories
                          hooks
